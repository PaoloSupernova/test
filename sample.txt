Test Thursday 11 January
I am looking forward to learning more about HTML and CSS, and especially beginning my journey with Python.

Trying one more time to add to Github from VS Code
When will we learn JavaScript?
And Python
And React
GitHub I am sure will make more sense the more I practice with it.
Will need to buy some books about it so I can do some additional reading.
